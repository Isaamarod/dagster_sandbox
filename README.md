# dagster_sandbox
Sandbox for building a data engineering pipeline with Dagster using uv as environment and package manager. The main branch starts with a minimal Dagster setup without Ibis or Impala. A future branch (feature/impala-ibis-ingestion) will extend the project with Ibis-based ingestion from Impala and layered data modeling (Bronze/Silver/Gold).
